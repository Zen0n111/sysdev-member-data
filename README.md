# SysDev Member Data

This repository contains static assets used for development of the [SysDev Website Frontend](https://github.com/SAMAHAN-Systems-Development/sysdev-website-frontend).

## Contents
- `members.json` — list of all members with their roles and positions
- `project-data.json` — list of all projects with their relevant information.
- `images/` — corresponding profile images for each member

## Purpose
This repo is used to stage and test team data separately before it is integrated into the main website. It allows the team to:
- Collaborate on member info and images
- Avoid breaking the main build
- Share updates safely and cleanly

## Usage
You may fetch or copy the contents of this repo into the main frontend project when ready. Make sure to test locally before integrating into production.

## Notes
- Please compress and name image files clearly (e.g., `juan-dela-cruz.jpg`)
- If adding new members, keep JSON formatting consistent
